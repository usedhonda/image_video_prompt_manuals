## Best Practices

1. **One primary movement** per shot - avoid combining pan + zoom + dolly
2. **Match movement to mood** - slow for emotional, fast for energetic
3. **Front-load camera direction** - mention movement early in prompt
4. **Use lens terminology** for specific looks
5. **Specify speed** when precision matters
