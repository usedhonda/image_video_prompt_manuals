| Laminar Flow | Smooth, undisturbed flow | Faucet water, poured oil |
| Rayleigh-Taylor Instability | Mushroom-cloud patterns at fluid interface | Ink in water, milk in coffee |
| Splash Crown | Crown-shaped splash on impact | Milk crown, high-speed water drops |
| Condensation | Micro-droplets on cold surface | Cold beer can, rainy window |
| Dispersion / Prismatic | Light splits into rainbow spectrum | Diamond, glass edge, oil film |
| Emulsion | Oil-water separation/mixing | Dressing, cosmetics, latte foam |
